# **Personal Portfolio**

#### This is a personal portfolio website that I intend to use when job hunting.  On this site I will host different projects that I will create over the years.  I did have some problems at the end with this project. 
I struggled to figure out how to upload this to github and when I did the formatting was wrong and the links do not work. On my local machine everything is perfect including the formatting and the links.  I spent hours troubleshooting and watched many tutorials to try to troubleshoot this problem.  
In spite of that I could not get the github version to be equivalent to my local machine's version.  I have no idea what I did wrong on the github side, but one day I will figure it out.
